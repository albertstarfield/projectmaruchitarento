# project マルチタレント virtual assistant
# code not yet published still in early stage
Project マルチタレント or (Orion its his/her AI name) is a multi capabilities virtual assistant AI project that focuses to be as close as jarvis while its core are built upon a hybrid online and offline principle 


however his/her capabilities reflect on how powerfull is your computer is
# To do 
1. Implementing features that helps high school students (Music Generation, Story Generation, Essay Generator, question and answer.. etc
2. Ram usage optimization so it able to run on much lower ram devices (RPI 3 etc...) <12GB
3. Smart Algorithmic Learning Scheduler to not get too much interuption while interacting with orion (idle pattern)
4. ( Still far off the future ) Enterprise Features thats have ability for ( such as : medical drug discovery , cancer reasearch etc..) ( Tensorflow Integration in Command line basically)
5. Basic Virtual Assistant Implementation
6. Power Optimization

# Usage
To load the AI into your system make sure you have enough free ram

bash bootloader.sh boot

currently designed only for archlinux x86 however its possible to port it to arm based device or debian
